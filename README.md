Hi! I am Mitchel Rojas (michi) from Valparaiso, Chile. 

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Telematics Engineering at 
the Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María.

In addition to my academic studies, I hold a technical degree in Electronics and 
I enjoy dedicating my free time to creative endeavors and personal development projects.

I love computer security, software development and Linux world.

... I also have another facet where I like History, Philosophy and Politics.

This is my little corner of code where I upload my projects and things that I develop... or not, enjoy it!
